4 things to know



obj 1: Define Bootstrap and why we use it?

  bootstrap is only a single file of css and also a single JS file that we can reuse in our own project's
  allows us to quickly build projects

obj 2: include bootstrap locally and by using a cdn

    using a cdn is best for performance because you are leveraging the users geographic location to their nearest server to download the api of bootstrap
    versus hosting it yourself

obj 3: use common bootstrap components like navs and buttons

  you can also layer your own stylings, and colors

obj 4: get comfortable using the bootstrap grid system  

  the grid system of bootstrap has to be the most powerful thing about the api
  the grid maxes out at 12 columns
